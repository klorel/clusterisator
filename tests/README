====== Tests ======
Here dwell the tests. We use the framework googlemock (http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/)

===== Compiling and running the tests=====
To compile and run the tests:
  - Download the framework googlemock and build gmock_main.a
  - Rename it to libgmock_main.a
  - Set the CMake option WITH_TEST to ON
  - Set the CMake option GMOCK_ROOT to the googlemock directory. This directory should contain in particular:
    * make/libgmock_main.a
    * gtest/include/gtest/gtest.h
  - Then, build the whole clusterisator project as usual: it should build the file code/tests
  - Run the binary code/tests
