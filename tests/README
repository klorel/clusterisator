====== Tests ======
Here dwell the tests. We use the framework googlemock (http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/)

===== Compiling and running the tests=====
To compile and run the tests:
  - Set the CMake option WITH_TEST to ON
  - Build the whole clusterisator project as usual: it should build the file code/tests
  - Run 'make test' or 'make test ARGS="-V"'
